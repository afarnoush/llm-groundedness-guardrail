You can choose between an **Unsecured Fixed Rate Personal Loan** (which doesn't require any collateral and offers fixed repayments) or an **Unsecured Variable Rate Personal Loan** (also without collateral and with a variable interest rate).

How do I apply for a personal loan?,"Via the CommBank website, app, or branch.",35,41,"To apply for a personal loan with Commonwealth Bank of Australia, please consider the following options based on your needs and circumstances:

1. Secured Personal Loan (if you have assets to offer as collateral): This option requires an asset like property or vehicle which can be used as security against repayment failure by way of foreclosure if necessary – a feature that typically leads to lower interest rates compared with unsecured loans. The amount ranges from $4,000 to $100,000 and you will have the option to choose between fixed or variable rate options.
   
2. Unsecured Fixed Rate Personal Loan (if your credit history is strong): This loan doesn't require any collateral but requires a good payment record for approval as it bears higher interest rates than secured loans due to the increased risk of non-repayment without security. The amount you can borrow ranges from $4,000 to $50,000 with fixed rate and fixed repayments ensuring predictability in your budgeting process.
   
3. Unsecured Variable Rate Personal Loan (if flexible payment options are desired): This loan option requires no collateral but comes at a higher risk for the bank due to possible non-repayment, thus increasing interest rates accordingly – making this less costly than secured loans when it comes time to repay. Borrowing amount is from $4,000 to $50,000 and with variable rate options which means your repayments can fluctuate based on the bank's prevailing interest rates at any given period of loan tenure - a potentially cost-effective option if you plan to pay off before higher rates apply.
   
Each application process differs slightly, but generally includes completing an online or paper form (either for secured personal loans with additional property details and valuation proof) , providing required identification documents like your passport, driver's license etc., a credit check by the bank to gauge affordability of repayments based on financial assessment, after which you will receive approval via email or letter from our loan officer.
You may also be able to speak directly with one if needed over phone - contact us at 1300 XXXX for more information about personal loans and application process specifics applicable under current laws in Australia (or visit your local branch). Remember, choosing the right option depends on individual financial situations – it's advisable you explore each thoroughly before making a decision.",2447,0.4044225215911865,"

How do I apply for a personal loan?,"Via the CommBank website, app, or branch.",35,41,"To apply for our Personal Loans at Commonwealth Bank, you can choose between secured and unsecured options based on your preference for collateral or fixed repayments. Here's how to start the application process step-by-step:

1. Decide which type of loan suits your needs better - if you have assets like property that could serve as security, consider a Secured Personal Loan with lower rates and borrowing amounts between $4,000–$100,000 in fixed or variable rate options; otherwise, opt for an Unsecured Fixed Rate Personal Loan without collateral at the same repayment flexibility but still within our minimum/maximum amount of $4,000-$50,000.
  
2. Log into your online account or visit a branch near you to initiate your loan application; we offer digital and in-person options for convenience!
   
3. Complete the personal information section, ensuring accuracy as it helps us assess eligibility based on factors like credit score and financial health. 
  
4. Provide details about how much capital you need to borrow (within your desired range) - remember that this will directly impact both interest rates and repayment amounts!
   
5. If applicable, attach any additional documentation requested for a thorough evaluation of loan approval eligibility; even though it's not mandatory in the case of Unsecured Loans (No collateral needed), we still appreciate transparency to ensure trust between us and you as our valued customer!
   
6. Submit your completed application - rest assured that all necessary steps will be promptly taken by our dedicated team, ensuring a hassle-free experience while bringing the benefits of low interest rates or fixed repayments closer at hand for securing personal funding (whether through asset collateralization in Secured Loans or not requiring it as with Unsecured Fixed Rate Personal Loan).
   
7. Await a response from our team - we aim to provide timely feedback and facilitate the process towards loan approval, ensuring you have all pertinent information about potential interest rates (fixed/variable), repayment terms, and amounts based on your specific needs within $4,000–$50,000. 
   
8. Once approved, we'll guide you through the next steps for disbursing funds into your account - with peace of mind knowing our commitment to responsible lending practices that enable us as a Commonwealth Bank Retail Products provider always prioritize customer satisfaction above all!",2429,0.4632543921470642,"

How do I apply for a personal loan?,"Via the CommBank website, app, or branch.",35,41,"To apply for a personal loan with Commonwealth Bank of Australia, follow these steps based on the provided contexts:
1. Choose between a secured or unsecured personal loan option as per your preference and financial situation. Secured options typically offer lower rates due to collateral backing but require you to put up an asset such as property as security against non-repayment of the debt, while unsecured loans do not necessitate any collateral for approval or fixed repayments at a potentially higher interest rate.
2. Decide on your loan amount and choose from borrowing $4,000 to up to $100,000 if you opt for the secured personal loan option. If that's not suitable, consider other available amounts within their offerings by checking with different products like Unsecured Fixed Rate Personal Loan or Variable Rate options which also allow borrowing between $4,000 to up to $50,000.
3. Choose the interest rate type based on your risk tolerance and financial goals – a fixed-rate option provides consistent repayments over time regardless of market changes while variable rates may fluctuate with economic conditions but often provide lower initial borrowing costs. The context mentions that both types are available for personal loans at Commonwealth Bank, so you'll need to decide based on your current financial situation and preferences after considering the terms offered in each option.
4. Since no explicit application instructions or steps have been provided directly from the given texts, it is advisable to contact the bank either through their website customer service channels (online forms) or by visiting a local branch for assistance with loan applications using these products as guided references based on your chosen criteria above.",1762,0.368732750415802,"

However, if you have a home loan that includes offset accounts where deposits are held against your mortgage balance to reduce interest charges and thus effectively pay off more principal each year - which may or may not be part of an Extra Home Loan offering – typically these loans do allow for redraw facilities allowing borrowers to access this money if needed.

How do I apply for a personal loan?,"Via the CommBank website, app, or branch.",35,41,"To apply for a personal loan at our bank, you have two primary options to consider based on the type of collateral and flexibility required during repayment periods that best suit your needs. The first option is an Unsecured Fixed Rate Personal Loan which requires no collateral but offers fixed rate interest along with predictable monthly payments, allowing you to borrow between $4,000–$50,000 for a personal loan. On the other hand, we also provide an Unsecured Variable Rate Personal Loan without any need of collateral and offering variable repayment options within the same amount range ($4,000- $50,000), providing you with more flexibility in managing your budget as interest rates may change.

For either option chosen, starting is simple – visit our local branch or website to initiate a loan application process wherein we will guide you through completing the necessary paperwork and submit it for approval by evaluating various financial aspects of your circumstances including credit history and income level among others. 

Once approved based on this assessment, you can finalize terms agreed upon with our bank representatives either online or at one of our branches, after which we will provide a loan agreement document that outlines all the details to be expected in regard to interest rate, repayments and duration for your personal loan. You may then proceed accordingly by signing this legally binding contract as part of finalizing terms regarding borrowing from us under these options.

Remember always it's crucial to consider carefully which option suits best according to one’s comfort with predictable or variable repayment schedules and whether you prefer no collateral security on your loan, thereby reducing risks associated towards asset depreciation while securing fundings for personal needs.",1828,0.35951632261276245,"
